            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Howdy, I'm **Mackenzie**! I'm a senior in **Business and CTD** from Colorado Springs! [cite: 29, 30] 
                My life's goal is to remain a kind, hardworking, and creative person in all of my pursuits. [cite: 31]
                My primary passions are working to preserve the **environment** and bring **communities together**, especially if those things can be done with **art and design**. [cite: 32]
                As a current **Marketing** and **Business Analytics** major with a minor in **C.T.D. (Creative Technologies in Design)**, [cite: 33] 
                I'm working to broaden my network and experiences to become a more **well-rounded leader**. [cite: 34]
