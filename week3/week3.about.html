            <p>
                My life's goal is to remain a kind, hardworking, and creative person in all of my pursuits. My primary passions are working to preserve the environment and bring communities together, especially if those things can be done with art and design. As a current Marketing and Business Analytics major with a minor in C.T.D. (Creative Technologies in Design). I'm working to broaden my network and experiences to become a more well-rounded leader.
